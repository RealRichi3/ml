## Interpretation of K-means Clustering Results

1. **Cluster Assignment**: The algorithm has assigned each data point to one of the two clusters based on the proximity to the centroids. The points are colored according to their cluster assignment.

2. **Centroids**: The final centroids are marked with a black 'x'. These centroids represent the mean position of the points in each cluster.

3. **Decision Boundary**: The decision boundary is the line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) that separates the clusters. In 2D, this boundary is typically a straight line that is equidistant from the centroids of the two clusters.

### Comments on the Decision Boundary:
- **Linear Boundary**: The decision boundary formed by K-means is linear. This is because K-means uses Euclidean distance to assign points to clusters, resulting in a linear separation between clusters.
  
- **Position of the Boundary**: The boundary is positioned such that it is equidistant from the centroids of the two clusters. This means that any point on the boundary is equally likely to belong to either cluster.

- **Effect of Overlapping Clusters**: Since the clusters are slightly overlapping, some points near the boundary may be misclassified. This is a common occurrence in K-means when clusters are not well-separated.

- **Sensitivity to Initialization**: The final clustering result can be sensitive to the initial placement of centroids. Different initializations can lead to different cluster assignments, especially in cases where clusters overlap.

Overall, the K-means algorithm has successfully identified two clusters in the dataset, and the decision boundary reflects the linear nature of the separation between these clusters.
