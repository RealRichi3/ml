- What is the difference between the training set and test set
- What does the RUL stand for 
- Are there other data preprocessin steps
- Compare other data preprocessing steps and see thier tradeoffs

# Data preprocessing
- What is the significance of feature extraction - What are features with little or no variablitity 
- How does prognosability analysis work and how was it used in this case
- What is normalization and what role does it play here
- What is response clipping
- Why do we need to limit RUL values to a maximum threshold to focus model on the critical degradation phase
- What is the critical degradation phase and why is it significant
- Why do we need to focus the model in this phase


# CNN model architecture
- What is the current model architecture
- What other architectures, their tradeoffs and how is the current architecture justified
- How does the current architecture work
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of the current architecture


# Training and Evaluation
- Why is the model trained using the Adamp optimizer, mean squar error loss, root mean squared error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric
- Are there alternative methods,
- What is the strength and weakness of this current approach.


# Results and
